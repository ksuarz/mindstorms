      <strong>Haiku Bot</strong> is a
      <a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com">Lego Mindstorm</a> robot that writes!
      This is a project for Rutgers' <a
      href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/undergraduate/courses/195/">Honors
      Computer Science Seminar</a> with Professor <a
      href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~mdstone/">Matthew Stone</a>.
      </p>

      <h1><a name="concept">Concept</a></h1>
      <p>
      The idea is simple: create a robot, based off of the Lego Mindstorm brick,
      that can compose and write haiku poems. For those that don't know, a <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/haiku">haiku</a> is a Japanese
      three-line poem consisting of five, seven and five syllables each.
      </p>

      <p>
      Haiku Bot's configuration is simple:
      <ul>
        <li> Two track treads for movement; </li>
        <li> One output motor for each tread; </li>
        <li> A Lego arm for holding a pen or marker; </li>
        <li> An output motor for raising/lowering the pen; and </li>
        <li> A body for holding the brick. </li>
      </ul>
      The robot is a simple robot, so it uses no sensory input. Thus, much of
      the turning and pen-writing is fragile and requires some calibration
      before use.
      </p>

      <p>
      The long-term goal was to create a robot skilled enough with a pen to
      write entire sentences. We had hoped to have precision control over the
      pen; this would allow us to write small, manageable letters that would
      allow us to compose entire poems in a reasonable amount of space. At the
      moment, Haiku Bot's motor skills are rather unwieldy and uncoordinated. It
      manages to write by simply dragging the pen or marker along with it,
      moving in patterns that mimic letters and numbers. Because of motor
      limitations and its wide turning radius, the characters it produces are
      very large; as a result, it requires at least a square meter of writing
      space just to produce a few numbers. Currently, Haiku Bot writes binary
      haiku poetry: combinations of zeros and ones.
      </p>

      <h1><a name="code">Code</a></h1>
      <p>
      All of our code is open-sourced <a
        href="https://github.com/ksuarz/mindstorms">on GitHub</a>.
      <p>
      Our code uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_eXactly C">Not
      eXactly C (NXC)</a>, a C-like high-level programming language for
      programming the Mindstorm brick. Due to its limitations, as well as the
      limited capabilities of the brick itself, we were somewhat restricted in
      how much Haiku Bot could accomplish.
      </p>

      <p>
      We created a few convenience functions for moving the Mindstorm around;
      they wrap some of the NXC API calls in an easier-to-use interface.

      </p>

      <p>
      The zero-one "haiku" code is simple: it uses some random-number generation
      to randomly select either a zero or one as its next number to draw,
      depending on the syllable count of the line. Each letter begins with some
      code to raise the pen; for the zero, it simply rotates 360 degrees; for
      the one, it attempts to move in a straight line. After drawing, Haiku Bot
      tries to recalibrate its position to move to the right of the previous
      letter.
      </p>

      <p>
      What about haiku poetry for humans? We've experimented with that too, but
      Haiku Bot isn't powerful enough to write them out yet. Our first draft of
      a haiku generator is a <a href="https://github.com/ksuarz/mindstorms/blob/master/haiku/haiku.c">tiny C program</a>:
      given a pre-composed list of five- and seven-syllable lines, it randomly
      chooses three lines to make an appropriate poem. Still, those lines were
      written by a human. For a more random haiku generation, we have a
      <a href="https://github.com/ksuarz/mindstorms/blob/master/haiku/poet.py">Python script</a>
      that takes as input a file consisting of words and their syllable content.
      It makes truly random choices as to which words to string together.
