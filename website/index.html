      <strong>Haiku Bot</strong> is a
      <a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com">Lego Mindstorm</a> robot that writes!
      </p>

      <h1><a name="concept">Concept</a></h1>
      <p>
      The idea is simple: create a robot, based off of the Lego Mindstorm brick,
      that can compose and write haiku poems. For those that don't know, a <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/haiku">haiku</a> is a Japanese
      three-line poem consisting of five, seven and five syllables each.
      </p>

      <p>
      The long-term goal was to create a robot skilled enough with a pen to
      write entire sentences. We had hoped to have precision control over the
      pen; this would allow us to write small, manageable letters that would
      allow us to compose entire poems in a reasonable amount of space. At the
      moment, Haiku Bot's motor skills are rather unwieldy and uncoordinated. It
      manages to write by simply dragging the pen or marker along with it,
      moving in patterns that mimic letters and numbers. Because of motor
      limitations and its wide turning radius, the characters it produces are
      very large; as a result, it requires at least a square meter of writing
      space just to produce a few numbers.
      </p>

      <h1><a name="code">Code</a></h1>
      <p>
      Our code uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_eXactly C">Not
      eXactly C (NXC)</a>, a C-like high-level programming language for
      programming the Mindstorm brick. Due to its limitations, as well as the
      limited capabilities of the brick itself, we were somewhat restricted in
      how much Haiku Bot could accomplish.
      </p>

      <p>
      We created a few convenience functions for moving the Mindstorm around;
      they wrap some of the NXC API calls in an easier-to-use interface.
