	the rabbit went home
	sweaters are fuzzy
	dinosaurs died out
	hot soup tastes yummy
	pizza conquers all
	the wind in the sky
	time is eternal
	horse ears are quite soft
	the mountains afar
	a blanket of snow
	doors open quickly
	pieces of cake rejected
	the lenses like eyes
	the ocean breeze
	summer butterflies
	a brand new crayon
	sound echoes through space
	
	
	geometrical
	hippopotamus
	congratulations
	kaleidoscopic
	accumulation
	cannibalism
